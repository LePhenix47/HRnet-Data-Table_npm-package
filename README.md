# Data table for HRnet

## What is this library for?

This npm package allows you to create a table of data, also a requirement for the P14 of the JS-React traineeship at [OpenClassrooms.com](OpenClassrooms.com) to create a sophisticated table with all the employees by simply passing the data as a prop to the component:

```jsx
 <DataTable data={[{prop: value, prop2: value}, {...}, ...]}/>
```
